# Hey there!
## Welcome my first discord bot's source code!
## It has some basic commands and is NOT updated to be compatible with the latest discord version. The last time I've updated this was on March 2020.

# Installing:
### First download the zip and unzip it.
### Then run `npm i && node index.js` to start the bot on its first start.
### After the first start, always start the bot by `node index.js`
### You may feel free to update this to suit the latest discord.js version.

## Lisence:
### MIT

## Please do not open issues because this repo will not be supported in any way.
